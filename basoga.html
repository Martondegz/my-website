    <p>In the eastern region, the Basoga practice a dance known as Tamenhaibunga  which expresses the importance of love and friendship. Its name literally means good friends drink together and don't fight in case they break the gourd holding the drink..
Probably the most widely recognised Ugandan dance is the  Kiganda, where the performers move their lower body to a drum-beat. It's a tricky dance, requiring great skill to keep the upper torso controlled and rotate to the music from the waist down. The dance has many variations for different occasions, but the version often seen is the one performed in honour of the Baganda king.</p>
