        <p>There are an estimated one million Maasai living in Kenya and Tanzania. They are perhaps one of the best known people of Africa due to the facts that they have a very interesting culture and that they live near many of Africaâ€™s most popular tourist attractions like the Serengeti, Massai Mara, Ngorongoro, Amboseli, and Tarangire game reserves.<br />

Although there have been many attempts by the government to <b>tame</b> the Maasai people by taking their land and turning it into national reserve parks and crop production land, they have maintained their  traditional customs,  culture, habits and traditional rituals for different rites of passage. They have remained cattle breeders, eating mostly meat and milk that they produce themselves. Traditionally, the Maasai people are recognizable by wearing sandals, black, blue and red clothes, which they wrap around their bodies.
